# news-scraper

In this assignment we create a web app that lets users view and leave comments on the latest news by scraping news from another site. We'll use Mongoose and Cheerio to scrape.

Use npm.init to also use the following modules:
- express
- express-handlebars
- mongoose
- body-parser
- cheerio
- request

The app must be deployed on Heroku where we'll need to set up an mLab provision. mLab is the remote MongoDB database that Heroku supports natively.
